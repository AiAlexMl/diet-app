# Macro & Menu Algorithm

## Macro Calculation (`calcMacro`)

- **BMR**: Harris-Benedict 1919
- **RMR** = BMR × 1.2
- **Calorie target**:
  - cut: RMR − `min(500, rmr×0.20)` (dynamic deficit, max 20% of RMR)
  - maintain: RMR
  - bulk: RMR + 300
  - Floor: `Math.max(target, female ? 1200 : 1500)`
- **Protein**: `weight × 2g`; if BMI ≥ 30, uses lean-body proxy (`25 × height_m²`) instead
- **Fat floor**: `max(25g men / 40g women, 20% of target ÷ 9)`
- **Carb floor**: if `protein×4 + fat×9 + 400 > target`, target is raised to fit — sets `S.carbWarning`
- **Carbs**: `(target − protein×4 − fat×9) / 4`

## State Flags

- `S.bmiWarning` — set by `buildMenu()`: cut+BMI<20 or bulk+BMI≥30
- `S.carbWarning` — set by `calcMacro()`: when target was raised to meet macro floor

## Menu Building (`buildMenu`)

1. Calls `calcMacro()`
2. Sets `S.bmiWarning` (cut+BMI<20 or bulk+BMI≥30)
3. Selects `MEAL_TIMES` schedule based on `S.time` / `S.noTrain`
4. For each meal calls `buildMeal(def.type, budget, used, ctx)`; shares a `used` Map (grams per food ID) and `ctx.usedCarbCats` for hot-carb variety
5. After all meals: if no fruit was used and `target > 1200`, injects one fruit into the snack

## Meal Templates (the realism mechanism)

Meals are built from **templates** (`MEAL_TEMPLATES` keyed by `breakfast`/`hot`/`snack`/`dinner`), not free category-mixing — so every meal is a coherent plate by construction.

`buildMeal(type)` → `chooseTemplate()` (keep templates whose required slots are fillable for the diet; prefer ones containing a liked food; weighted-random) → `buildFromTemplate()` fills each slot.

A **slot**: `{ match(f,used) | special, calPct, protPct?, max, optional?, spread? }`.
- `special`: `'salad'`→`buildSalad`; `'hotveg'`/`'hotveg_or_salad'`→`buildSingleVeg`/(~40% hot veg else salad); `'hot_carb'`→prefers an unused carb category via `ctx.usedCarbCats`.
- otherwise `pick()` from `ALL.filter(match)`.
- `spread:'ifAlone'` → `makeSpread()` adds a condiment (tahini/PB) to a bread/cracker **only if the meal has no protein yet** (so cottage/egg/tuna meals get no spread). The bread's `displayName` shows "עם X"; the spread is a **separate row** with its own grams/calories.

Templates: **breakfast** eggs / cheese / yogurt_bowl / porridge / cornflakes / oats_water; **hot** meat (w3) / legume (w1) / tuna (w1); **snack** dairy_fruit / fruit_nuts / cracker_cheese / shake; **dinner** cheese_bread / tuna_bread / big_salad.

## Food role flags (enforce realism, set in `data.js`)

- `condiment` (olive oil, tahini, peanut butter) — never standalone; only via `attachSpread` on bread/cracker
- `drink` (milk) — never a protein; only the `milk` slot in cornflakes template
- `complete` (oatmeal-with-milk 106) — self-contained breakfast; its template has no protein slot

Legumes are a `hot`/`big_salad` main (so vegetarians/vegans get protein); meat outweighs legume 3:1 for omnivores.

## Tuna rule

`tunaUsed(used)` gates all tuna pools: only one tuna type per menu, capped at one can (`maxDay:160`).

## `buildSalad` Rules

- Requires ≥ 2 **regular** (`salad` tag, not `salad_only`) vegetables as base
- Optional 3rd veg from `salad_only` pool (lettuce, cabbage, onion) or a 3rd regular veg
- Olive oil (id:86) always added if permitted — **5g (כפית)**, no daily-use restriction
- Parts display: `f.name.includes(' ') ? name + ' (' + unitLabel + ')' : unitLabel`

## Portion Helpers

- `eggDisplay(g, unitW, size)` — rounds to 1–2 eggs by weight, appends size label (M/L/XL)
- `crackerPortion(targetG, unitW)` — snaps to 2–6 pieces using the cracker's own `unitG`
- `cottagePortion(targetG)` — 250g full / 125g half container

## `pick()` Priority

1. Foods in `S.liked` → `allowed()` → not in `used` — **shuffled** (Fisher-Yates)
2. All other allowed foods not yet used — **also shuffled** (for menu variety across regenerations)
3. Serving size: calculated from calorie/protein budget, snapped to `unitG`, clamped to `maxDay`/`maxMeal`

Liked foods always outrank non-liked (liked group comes first); both groups are shuffled internally so menus vary while preferences are still honored. `buildSalad` and `buildSingleVeg` shuffle their non-liked pools the same way.

## `mkItem()` Return Shape

```js
{ f, g, dispG, displayName?, cal, p, c, fat, fib }
```
- `displayName` set only for eggs: "חביתה מביצה אחת (L)"; `dispG` is `''`
- All other items: `displayName` is `undefined`; `dispG` holds the portion string
- `fib` — fiber grams for the served portion (`f.fib || 0`); meals sum it to `totFib`, daily total shown in summary with a `~14g/1000kcal` target hint
